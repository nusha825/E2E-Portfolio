# Challenges Faced & How You Overcame Them
1. CSS Not Loading Properly

Issue: Styles were not applied when viewing the site in the browser.
Solution:

- Checked if the CSS file path was correct and used relative paths

```bash
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

- Ensured the CSS file was saved and correctly linked in index.html.


# 2. JavaScript Not Working

Issue: JavaScript functions weren‚Äôt executing properly.

Solution:

Opened DevTools (F12 ‚Üí Console) to check for errors.

Used console.log() to debug.

Ensured the script was properly linked in index.html:

```bash
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

- Placed the script before closing the <body> tag or used defer to ensure it loads after the page:

```bash
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

# 3. Images or Links Not Showing
Issue: Images or links were broken when viewed on GitHub Pages.

Solution:

Used relative paths instead of absolute paths. Example:

```bash
<img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile">
```

# 4. GitHub Pages Not Updating
Issue: After making changes and pushing updates, the website didn‚Äôt reflect the latest version.

Solution:

Cleared the browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac).

Made sure all changes were committed and pushed.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated portfolio"
git push origin main
```

Verified that GitHub Pages was enabled in the repository settings
